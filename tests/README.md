This directory contains tests that are run to verify that the DEA Intertidal code runs correctly. The ``test_intertidal.py`` file runs a small-scale full workflow analysis over an intertidal flat in the Gulf Carpentaria using the DEA Intertidal [Command Line Interface (CLI) tools](../notebooks/Intertidal_CLI.ipynb), and compares these results against a LiDAR validation DEM to produce some simple accuracy metrics.

The latest integration test completed at **2023-12-22 10:40**. Compared to the previous run, it had an:
- RMSE accuracy of **0.15 m (:heavy_minus_sign: no change)**
- MAE accuracy of **0.12 m (:heavy_minus_sign: no change)**
- Bias of **0.11 m (:heavy_minus_sign: no change)**
- Pearson correlation of **0.951 (:heavy_minus_sign: no change)**
