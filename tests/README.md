This directory contains tests that are run to verify that DEA Intertidal code runs correctly. The ``test_intertidal.py`` file runs a small-scale full workflow analysis over an intertidal flat in the Gulf of Carpentaria using the DEA Intertidal [Command Line Interface (CLI) tools](../notebooks/Intertidal_CLI.ipynb), and compares these results against a LiDAR validation DEM to produce some simple accuracy metrics.

The latest integration test completed at **2024-03-07 18:52**. Compared to the previous run, it had an:
- RMSE accuracy of **0.15 m ( :heavy_exclamation_mark: worsened by 0.006)**
- MAE accuracy of **0.13 m ( :heavy_exclamation_mark: worsened by 0.005)**
- Bias of **0.12 m ( :heavy_exclamation_mark: worsened by 0.004)**
- Pearson correlation of **0.977 ( :heavy_check_mark: improved by 0.001)**
