    "### Intertidal Exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "Intertidal coastlines support a wide array of habitats and coastal and marine species.\n",
    "Low energy tidal flats often support mangrove and seagrass habitats which in turn play host to sea birds, mammals and reptiles. \n",
    "Tropical and subtropical intertidal coral reefs provide habitat, food and shelter, soft sediment coastlines support microphytobenthos and intertidal algaes are ubiquitously distributed across Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined effects of tide, sun and air make intertidal environments one of the most dynamic places to live on Earth.\n",
    "Consequently, ecological niches exist within these environments where optimal conditions can be changeable over timescales that range from daily to seasonally and beyond.\n",
    "Seagrass, coral and algae, for instance, all experience decline in varying combination with the season, level of solar irradiance and air temperature.\n",
    "The prevalence of these species in intertidal habitats can further influence the presence and distribution of other intertidal occupying species, such as seabirds and dugongs.\n",
    "<!-- Seagrass, coral and algae have all been found to decline under conditions of high solar irradiance when combined with air temperature and aerial exposure.\n",
    "Declines in seagrass biomass are high from summer through to winter while algae dessication and stress occurs when exposure corresponds to coupled high irradiance and high air temperature during warmer months.\n",
    "Coversely, intertidal corals experience a seasonal mortality risk that peaks in early spring when exposure during seasonally low tides combines high irradiance and low air temperatures. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Temporal differences in intertidal exposure patterns also affect marine fauna in coastal environments.\n",
    "For instance, seagrass dominated intertidal habitats provide foraging ground for turtles and dugongs.\n",
    "The daily occurrence of exposure in these environments dictates the time available to these species to forage the nitrogren rich seagrasses of elevated intertidal areas.\n",
    "Typically, these species forage intertidal areas during night-time high-tides.\n",
    "Seasonal shifts in the timing of night-time high-tides can significantly influence available foraging times across the year. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Intertidal exposure describes the amount of time that intertidal areas are exposed to air from tide coverage.\n",
    "Leveraging intertidal elevation mapping, the exposure calculation translates high resolution tidal modelling to determine percentage exposure times for intertidal regions, at 10<sup>2</sup> m resolution.\n",
    "Exploiting the local influences of tidal harmonic inputs into global tidal modelling, intertidal exposure mapping can tease out exposure patterns over temporal scales such as day, night or season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping the exposure dynamics of intertidal areas and contrasting their patterns of change over varying timescales supports our ability to further characterise and understand intertidal habitats.\n",
    "Supporting a vast array of important marine species, it also offers insights into how exposure patterns influence species behaviours and distributions over short to long timescales.\n"

    "### Introduction to the Intertidal Exposure calculation method\n",
    "\n",
    "DEA Intertidal Exposure models the percentage of time that any intertidal pixel of known elevation is exposed from tidal inundation. \n",
    "Exposure is calculated by comparing the pixel elevation back against a high temporal resolution model of tide heights for that location, based on an ensemble tidal modelling approach. \n",
    "Exposure percentage is calculated as the fraction of tidally exposed observations (those lower than the target elevation) relative to the total number of tide model observations, generated for the 3-year product epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is demonstrated in the figure below where panel a shows the digital elevation model, produced for the three year epoch spanning 2016 for Carnot Bay in Western Australia.\n",
    "A high temporal resolution tide model was generated at 30 minute intervals for the same temporal epoch (panel b).\n",
    "Intertidal exposure (panel c) is calculated from the cumulative percentage distribution (panel d) of modelled tide heights (panel b).\n",
    "For any intertidal elevation in the area of interest (panel a), the percentile distribution of modelled tide heights (panel d) equates to the fraction of modelled tide heights (panel b) that were exposed during the modelled epoch.\n",
    "Where percentile of modelled tide heights (panel d) is used as a proxy for time, \n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> Exposure <sub>Elevation z</sub> = Tide  height  percentile * 100 %</p>\n",
    "In panel d, this is demonstrated by the grey-dashed line, where\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> Exposure <sub>-1.0 msl</sub> =0.3 * 100 = 30 %</p>\n",
    "In other words, 30 % of tide heights, modelled at 30 min intervals between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2017 (panel b), occur at or below intertidal elevations of -1.0 msl, meaning this elevation is exposed from inundation for 30 % of the modelled time period (panel d).\n",

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The default Smithburne River, QLD, location is located on the eastern banks of Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria.\n",
    "The area of interest for this study is a recurved sand spit which has been developing over recent decades and is being stabilised by the development of mangrove forest.\n",
    "The animation above shows annual changes to intertidal area between 2016 and 2022.\n",
    "Panel a shows the location in satellite imagery.\n",
    "Note that the annual median imagery shows approximately median tide levels, disguising much of the intertidal area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panels b-e represent some of the intertidal features mapped annually for this location from the DEA Intertidal dataset suite.\n",
    "The intertidal digital elevation model in panel b demonstrates a tide range within approximately +/- 1.5 m above mean sea level.\n",
    "This elevation model is a primary input into the intertidal exposure model (panel c).\n",
    "Intertidal exposure values represent the percentage of time during the epoch that every 10 m<sup>2</sup> pixel was exposed to the air. \n",
    "Although this location appears to represent a fairly complete range of modelled exposure values (%), careful examination shows that extrema values are not captured by this model.\n",
    "This is because there is an offset in satellite image acquisition that fails to capture tide heights at both ends of the tidal spectrum (panels d,e) which gets reflected in the exposure model.\n",
    "This concept is captured by mapping of high and low tide offsets during the epoch of interest (panels d,e).\n",
    "These panels show that satellites failed to image this location during the top 3-9 % of high tides (panel d) and during the bottom 0-7 % of low tides (panel e) during the timeseries.\n",
    "These offsets should be kept in mind when interpreting the spatial outputs of any exposure mapping undertaken using this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temporally Filtered Exposure Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated in the [method](#Background), intertidal exposure is calculated by comparing tide heights from a high temporal resolution tide model to an intertidal digital elevation model.\n",
    "By filtering out time-periods of interest from the tide model, customised exposure maps can be generated.\n",
    "The following case studies explore this application by mapping single and paired filters to explore the influence of seasonality and solar inundation on intertidal exposure.\n",

    "Daytime exposure mapping by season reveals the dynamicism of intertidal environments across a given year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the Austral autumn and winter at this location, very little intertidal zone is exposed for more than 70 % of the time (0.31 and 0.38 km<sup>2</sup> respectively).\n",
    "Additionally, over 3/4 of the total intertidal area experiences exposure for less than 30 % of daylight hours during these cooler seasons.\n",
    "In the spring and summer seasons, intertidal area in the medium exposure class (30 < exp < 70 %) has transitioned from the autumn and winter low-exposure classes (< 30 %).\n",
    "Similarly, greater portions of warm-season intertidal area in the highly exposed (> 70 %) class are most-likely sourced from cool season medium-exposure classes.\n",
    "Consequently, warmer seasons (spring and summer) see greater proportions of the intertidal area exposed to the sun and air than cooler seasons (autumn and winter), and large proportions of the intertidal zone is accustomed to being inundated for long periods during the cooler months.\n",
    "\n",
    "These modelled observations align with field observations related to the stress and mortality of many organisms in intertidal zones.\n",
    "For example, [Buckee et al., 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.904191/full) modelled emersion mortality risk in  Australian shallow coral reefs and found that across the continent, emersion related coral-mortality risk was generally greatest during the Australian spring time.\n",
    "Across Australia, causal mechanisms included combinations of mean sea level minima, high incidence of solar irradiation and low daytime air temperatures with exposure time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, seagrass biomass typically peaks around late spring and begins to decline, with minima observed during winter. \n",
    "Seagrass stress and decline has been observed to occur in combination with aerial exposure and maximum daily solar irradiances [e.g. Petrou et al., 2013](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v482/p93-106/). \n",
    "Algaes also decline under similar conditions, with the addition of temperature being shown to cause dessication and stress during periods of exposure [e.g. Yu et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385110113000440).\n",

    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a stark pattern in the monthly night-time inundation characteristics of this location.\n",
    "Between September and January each year, more than half of the intertidal zone is inundated for more than 70 % of night-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seasonality may well be influential on dugong distributions and life-cycles.\n",
    "The nutritional content of intertidal seagrass varies with elevation and dugong have been observed to venture inshore at night to forage on varieties only available at high tide [(e.g. Sheppard et al., 2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2010.00374.x)[, Derville et al., 2022).](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04412-3)\n",
    "There is some evidence that dugong herds are larger and less dispersed during spring and summer, when seagrass meadows are large and highly productive [(Lanyon 2003)](https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR98082).\n",
    "This analysis shows that those meadows are also readily accessible during preferred foraging hours at this time of the year.\n",
    "Female dugong fertility is correspondingly most active between July and December with calving concentrated around August to December each year [(Marsh et al., 1984](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248901675_Breeding_Cycle_Life_History_and_Population_Dynamics_of_the_Dugong_Dugon_dugon_Sirenia_Dugongidae)[; Burgess., 2012)](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:301919), when nutritious food is abundant and accessible.\n",
    "Spatial and temporal mapping of exposure characteristics in known dugong habitat reveals that access to nutritious food, in addition to seagrass abundance, is linked to seasonality and may influence the life cycle and reproductive success of the vulnerable dugong species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping the exposure characteristics of intertidal habitats reveals important insights and influences on the distribution and life-cycles of the species that occupy them.\n",
    "Exposure time is a critically influential element in intertidal ecosystems and the ability to map it over time and space enables improved understanding of these environments for conservation and management."
