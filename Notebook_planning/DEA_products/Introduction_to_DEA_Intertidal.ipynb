    "| 1 | Inland intermittent wet | Pixels that are variably detected as wet through the time-series but are uncorrelated to tide, unconnected to the intertidal class and do not intersect with urban areas. This class includes semi-permanent water bodies and water features whose connection to the intertidal class has changed during the time-series and includes intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs).  |\n",
    "| 2 | Inland persistent wet  | Pixels that are frequently detected as wet and are unconnected to the intertidal class. This class will include coastal lakes and lagoons that were wet and unconnected to intertidal pixels for the entire time-series. |\n",
    "| 3 | Tidal influenced persistent wet | Pixels that are frequently detected as wet and are connected to the intertidal class. This class also includes pixels that are variably detected as wet and are connected to the intertidal class, despite being uncorrelated to tide. This class typically includes the ocean and tide channels. |\n",
    "| 4 | Intertidal low confidence | Pixels that are variably detected as wet and are correlated to tide yet do not have a valid elevation value. These pixels often fringe the intertidal zone and are likely to be intertidal but are included in the low confidence class as their variability with tide occurs completely above or below the wet/dry frequency threshold. |\n",

    "A rolling median is applied from low to high tide to reduce noise (e.g. white water, sunglint, non-tidal water level variability), then analysed to identify the tide height at which the pixel transitions from dry to wet. \n",
